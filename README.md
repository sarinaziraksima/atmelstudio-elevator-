# atmelstudio-elevator

For designing an elevator in Atmel Studio, we used buttons and LEDs to model the system in Proteus, indicating the floors and the current state of the elevator. First, the elevator will go to the floors where people are waiting on the top floors. If no floors are selected, the elevator will go to the lower floors if needed. This approach allows us to gather all the people waiting on different floors, as their final destination may be the ground floor. This provides efficiency to the system.
